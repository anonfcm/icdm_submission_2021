Code will be improved as time goes on, but is already runnable provided you have the datasets. For the IoT dataset, download it from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT
The remaining datasets can be downloaded from scikit-learn's functions. 

To run the experiment, run the forest_experiment.py script, the iot_experiment.py script and the kdd_experiment.py script respectively.
